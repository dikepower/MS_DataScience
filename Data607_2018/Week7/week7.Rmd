library("rvest")

library("jsonlite")
library("RCurl")
#install.packages("htmltab")
#library("htmltab")
```

Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the difference between JSON, XML and HTML files. Create a file of each type to store information on 3 books. Then parse the files into a data frame. Are all three data frames the same?

Parse XML 
 
 
 
```{r}
url <- "book.html"
html_df <-  readHTMLTable(url , header = TRUE)
html_df 
```
 
 
 
```{r}
html_df 
```
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
