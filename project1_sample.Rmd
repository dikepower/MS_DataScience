## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(stringr)

chess_fields <- c("Number", "Name", "Points", "R1", "R2", "R3", "R4", "R5", "R6", "R7", "EOL")
tournament <- read.table("./tournamentinfo.txt", header = FALSE, skip = 4, sep = "|", fill = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, col.names = chess_fields)
```

## Including Plots


```{r}
tournament <- subset(tournament, !Name == "", select = c(Number:R7))
head(tournament)
```

```{r}
library(stringr)
for (i in 1:length(tournament)) {
  tournament[, i] <- str_trim(tournament[, i])
}
```



```{r}
head(tournament)
```



```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(tournament)) {
  tournament$State[i] <- tournament$Number[i + 1]
  tournament$Player[i] <- str_trim(str_extract(tournament$Name[i + 1], "[[:blank:]]{1}[[:digit:]]{3,4}"))
}
tournament <- subset(tournament, !is.na(Player))
```


```{r}
head(tournament)
```


```{r}
for (i in 4:10) {
  tournament[, i] <- str_trim(str_extract(tournament[, i], "[[:space:]]+[[:digit:]]{1,2}"))
}
```

```{r}
head(tournament,)
```





```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(tournament)) {
  for(j in 4:10) {
    tournament[i,j] <- tournament[tournament$Number == tournament[i,j],12][1]
    # [1] at end avoids error from NAs
  }
}
```


```{r}
head(tournament)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
